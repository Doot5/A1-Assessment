## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Doot5/New-Assessment/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Doot5/New-Assessment/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

Personal Information
My name is Ben Wakefield. My Student number is. s3912783, and you can contact me through my Student email address (S3912783@student.rmit.edu.au). I’ve always had an interest in programing, drawing, and technology so if possible, I would like to get onto a career path that relates to at least one of these subjects. I was born and raised in Australia. I graduated from Springwood State Highschool in 2020d, and I'm usually the quiet type but I like to spend my free time with my friends or playing video games for fun.

Interest in IT
I have always been curious with how the things around me work. As for the reason for me choosing RMIT over other Tafe courses is because it’ s online study, that way I can work around a busy schedule since I'm still casual. I have no experience in the IT department as of now, but I intend to change that in the near future. Therefore my plan is to understand how many steps are needed in order to make a well performing website/games. Than gain skills to be able to manufacture those ideas into reality.

Ideal Job
As of now, I still have no idea what I want to do for my career. But some branches that peak my interest are;

• Computer Systems Configure and Test Seek.com.au

• Electron’s production engineer Seek.com.au

• Platform Developer Seek.com.au

• 3D Animation Seek.com.au

• Game developer

I am interested in these positions because they seem like an interesting and fun environment to be in. I like the idea of experimenting with code, animation, assembling and testing electronics and it being presented in a way that can be of use to others even in non-ordinary situations. As for the requirements needed for each of these, the one trait they all have in common is that they require good problem-solving capabilities, high work proficiency, good teamwork, a degree in said department and at least 2-3 years of hands-on experience at an industry environment. Additionally, for an 3D Animater/Game developer it is required that you have on how game engines work, being able to make 3D or 2D models based on a source material, good mentality, and the ability to work well under deadlines. As of now, I only have some of these qualifications such as high proficiency in work situations and the ability to work under pressure. The rest I will have to work on but those will have to come with time. To overcome these issues, I hope that the group projects throughout this unit will help me develop more skills in communication as well as teamwork. Furthermore, I intend to do independent research on how I can be improving my methods. I do not really know what its like to be part of an actual team yet since all the teams/groups I have been within the past at least one person has been dead weight and I have ended up worrying about every little mistake.

Project Ideas
I honesty don't know what to put here

1 tech topic + 1 non tech topic

an example would be snowboarding, hiking, etc

and linking wireless tech.

Think about how these things can be improved upon
