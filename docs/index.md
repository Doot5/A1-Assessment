<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>My name is Ben Wakefield. My Student number is. s3912783, and you can contact me through my Student email address (S3912783@student.rmit.edu.au).
I’ve always had an interest in programing, drawing, and technology so if possible, I would like to get onto a career path that relates to at least one of these subjects. I was born and raised in Australia. 
I graduated from Springwood State Highschool in 2020d, and I'm usually the quiet type but I like to spend my free time with my friends or playing video games for fun.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have always been curious with how the things around me work. As for the reason for me choosing RMIT over other Tafe courses is because it’ s online study, that way I can work around a busy schedule since I'm still casual. I have no experience in the IT department as of now, but I intend to change that in the near future. Therefore my plan is to understand how many steps are needed in order to make a well performing website/games. Than gain skills to be able to manufacture those ideas into reality.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>As of now, I still have no idea what I want to do for my career. But some branches that peak my interest are;</p>
<p>•	Computer Systems Configure and Test
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52531566?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=9f8832fd-c94f-4e02-9891-bf28722b0595">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Electron’s production engineer 
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52500325?type=standard#searchRequestToken=82b12d87-2498-4ed0-97e1-b30600aee2d7">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Platform Developer
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52356347?type=standout#searchRequestToken=1fc6d478-638b-448e-84dd-fc8979b774c5">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	3D Animation 
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52296654?type=standard#searchRequestToken=6e7b97f4-83d9-4d0f-9798-faf9b9f4827a">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Game developer</p>
<p>I am interested in these positions because they seem like an interesting and fun environment to be in. I like the idea of experimenting with code, animation, assembling and testing electronics and it being presented in a way that can be of use to others even in non-ordinary situations.
As for the requirements needed for each of these, the one trait they all have in common is that they require good problem-solving capabilities, high work proficiency, good teamwork, a degree in said department and at least 2-3 years of hands-on experience at an industry environment. Additionally, for an 3D Animater/Game developer it is required that you have on how game engines work, being able to make 3D or 2D models based on a source material, good mentality, and the ability to work well under deadlines.
As of now, I only have some of these qualifications such as high proficiency in work situations and the ability to work under pressure. The rest I will have to work on but those will have to come with time. 
To overcome these issues, I hope that the group projects throughout this unit will help me develop more skills in communication as well as teamwork. Furthermore, I intend to do independent research on how I can be improving my methods.
I do not really know what its like to be part of an actual team yet since all the teams/groups I have been within the past at least one person has been dead weight and I have ended up worrying about every little mistake.

<h1>Profile</h1>
<p>In order to portray what type of learning style I have, I went ahead and did some online test to see where my strengths are. The results within the tables down below show specifically my learning style and personaliity.</p>

      <h3>Personality</h3>
    <table style="width:30%">

      <th>Total Points</th>

    </tr>
  </table></p>

<p>The results of these online test display that my prefered learning style is through Visual and Logical stand points. While being mostly introverted, therefore I tend to avoid others and may not be as interesting as others</p>

<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<p>I honesty don't know what to put here</p>
<p>1 tech topic + 1 non tech topic</p>
<p>an example would be snowboarding, hiking, etc</p>
<p>and linking wireless tech. </p>
<p>Think about how these things can be improved upon </p>
