<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>My name is Ben Wakefield. My Student number is. s3912783, and you can contact me through my Student email address (S3912783@student.rmit.edu.au).
I’ve always had an interest in programing, drawing, and technology so if possible, I would like to get onto a career path that relates to at least one of these subjects. I was born and raised in Australia. 
I graduated from Springwood State Highschool in 2020, and I'm usually the quiet type so I like to spend my free time with my group of friends or playing video games for fun.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have always been curious with how the things around me work. As for the reason for me choosing RMIT over other Tafe courses, it would have to be the fact that it’s online study, that way I can work around a busy schedule since I'm still casual. I have no experience in the IT department as of now, but I intend to change that in the near future. Therefore my plan is to understand how many steps are needed in order to make a well performing website/games. Than gain skills to be able to manufacture those ideas into reality.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>As of now, I still have no idea what I want to do for my career. But some branches that peak my interest are;</p>
<p>•	Computer Systems Configure and Test
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52531566?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=9f8832fd-c94f-4e02-9891-bf28722b0595">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Electron’s production engineer 
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52500325?type=standard#searchRequestToken=82b12d87-2498-4ed0-97e1-b30600aee2d7">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Platform Developer
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52356347?type=standout#searchRequestToken=1fc6d478-638b-448e-84dd-fc8979b774c5">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	3D Animation 
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52500335?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=f376626f-69e5-471b-b537-edf57daba2e2">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Game developer</p>
      
<p>I am interested in these positions because they seem like an interesting and fun environment to be in. I like the idea of experimenting with code, animation, assembling and testing electronics and it being presented in a way that can be of use to others even in non-ordinary situations.
As for the requirements needed for each of these, the one trait they all have in common is that they require good problem-solving capabilities, high work proficiency, good teamwork, a degree in said department and at least 2-3 years of hands-on experience at an industry environment. Additionally, for an 3D Animater/Game developer it is required that you have to know how game engines work, being able to make 3D or 2D models based on a source material, good mentality and the ability to work well under deadlines.
As of now, I only have some of these qualifications such as high proficiency in work situations and the ability to work under pressure. The rest of the qualifications I will have to work on but those will have to come with time. 
To overcome these issues, I hope that the group projects throughout this unit will help me develop more skills in communication as well as teamwork. Furthermore, I intend to do independent research on how I can be improving my methods and understanding game engines if my career goes in that direction.</p>

<p>16Personalities  -  Turbulent Logistician. 

Strengths: 

Honest and Direct – Integrity is the heart of the Logistician personality type. Emotional manipulation, mind games and reassuring lies all run counter to Logisticians’ preference for managing the reality of the situations they encounter with plain and simple honesty. 

Strong-willed and Dutiful – Logisticians embody that integrity in their actions too, working hard and staying focused on their goals.  

Very Responsible – Logisticians’ word is a promise, and a promise means everything. Logisticians would rather run themselves into the ground with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver the results they said they would. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for Logistician personalities, and they fulfill their duties to the people and organizations they’ve committed themselves to. 

Jacks-of-all-trades – Much like Analyst personality types, Logisticians are proud repositories of knowledge, though the emphasis is more on facts and statistics than concepts and underlying principles. This allows Logisticians to apply themselves to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course. 

Weaknesses: 

Stubborn – The facts are the facts, and Logisticians tend to resist any new idea that isn’t supported by them. This factual decision-making process also makes it difficult for people with the Logistician personality type to accept that they were wrong about something – but anyone can miss a detail, even them. 

Insensitive – While not intentionally harsh, Logisticians often hurt more sensitive types’ feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. Logistician personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said. 

Always by the Book – Logisticians believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments leave Logisticians all but paralyzed. 

Often Unreasonably Blame Themselves – All this can combine to make Logisticians believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, Logisticians sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can’t deliver. Since they’ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, Logisticians then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.</p>

Visual 

If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning. 
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery. 
Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better: 
      
·         Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!) 
·         Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis. 
·         Use flashcards to learn new words. 
·         Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you. 
·         Write down key words, ideas, or instructions. 
·         Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures. 
·         Color code things. 
·         Avoid distractions during study times. 

Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.

    <h3>Creative Score</h3>

<p>
  What do the results mean to me?
I think these results are mostly true, although I do identify myself as these results. I am someone who is hard working once they are motivated, believes in achieving the best outcome through simplistic means and enjoys learning how to implement HMTL code, but only when I’m not pressured by a deadline. 

How do I think this will influence my behavior in a team?
I think these results reflect my ability to work in a team. Since I’m usually doing projects alone, I’m often too harsh on myself for making small mistakes. However, my experience with group projects so far has told me that its ok to ask for help. 

How will this affect me joining a team?
I believe I can fit in most teams, as I’m usually committed and hard working towards the end result. In order to succeed, I usually take things a step at a time and like to set deadlines early, this way I can help any others that may need it. Although things may not always go to plan when planning around casual shifts.  </p>




<h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <p>     <h3>Overview</h3>
My project idea  will be developing a game similar to rolling marbles using the Unity engine, except in this one you control the marble in VR/AR. This take of the game will involve unique courses, challenges, and several ways to screw with your friends, which is similar to Mario cart. This project will most likely be difficult since I am still new to unity, thus I do not know how the unity engine works and the script’s unity is based on that well.
If you consider the normal Rolling Marbles game, where you place a marble and watch it go down a slope while competing with dozens of other marbles from a screen, the experience is rather bland. So I want change that aspect in a way that can make it more fun and interactive as well as open new possibilities in the near future. This way the game will not be completely luck based and will encourage the player to improve, even if it is a little.</p>
    <p><h3>My motivation</h3>
So my introduction to code is through GitHub and html, but at the beginning of developing a website, I  found it similar to watching a tv series that never ends, which makes it rather tiresome after a few hours. Its also easy to get distracted with so many paths to take but than I came across game development, which to me is like watching a movie. A major factor that helped to make this choice was Bigponds616’s GitHub home page. If you go to his profile, you can see that he has several replica’s of games such as Fruit ninja, Angry birds, Rolling balls and Line rider which inspired me to make this project idea.</p>
    <p><h3>Description</h3>
Since this a game, it will be used for entertainment, but for it to be similar to Mario cart, it needs to have situations that can cause chaos for the players, so factors such as power ups, a variety of ways to go, camera movement and obstacles need to be accounted for. 
The power ups will be.</p>
<p>•	A rocket, an easy to see obstacle that moves in a forward motion, if it hits a player it will stop them for 1 second and will be able to open up certain pathways of the course.</p>
<p>•	A slight speedup, which will leave a trail of particles behind you.</p>
<p>•	Invincibility</p>
<p>•	A hook shot, this will course you to attach a hook to a player ahead of you, causing you to gain speed while they slow down. the further they are the better result it brings.</p>
<p>•	Bomb, an area affect power up which blows up after 3 seconds if not touched by a player.</p>
<p>The courses will have to be the right length otherwise it will be boring for the player and the shortcuts for each course will have to be fair so that it doesn’t give an unfair advantage and that becomes the ‘go to route' for that course.
As for the shape of the course/slope, it will be a hollow cylinder cut in half. It will be on an angle to give players momentum, this way the players can decide to jump off the course into a separate sections or stay on the main course.<p>

<p>Since the game is based around marbles going down a slope, I do not want there to be a stop option, but rather the player will be encouraged to go fast as they can to be able to make jumps you would not normally be able to. This will reward the player by giving them a powerup and a slight lead, but not getting them too far ahead making them untouchable for other players. </p>
      
<p>Natural obstacles that will occur throughout courses will be falling rocks that will be a different color than the track so you can see them ahead of time, but since they are going to be falling down on the course some players might not see them, so an indication zone for at least 3-5 seconds will occur before it actually lands.
As for the movement, the VR users will have to either lean in the direction they want or use the VR controller for movement. While PC users will have to use a mouse and keyboard to direct their movement. </p>
      
<p>Since VR will be being used for this project, the marbles will have to be slightly modified if a 1st person camera is being used or a 3rd person camera. 
I want the camera to be in 3rd person, so that you can see yourself rolling but that will not really work form a VR standpoint. Thus, players will be able to set their camera position to either inside the marble or from a 3rd person perspective. </p>
      
<p>Additionally, the collision will have to be done in a way so that a slight tap will not send a player flying, this will be done by configuring with the momentum of the marble. So, when one player hits another, they will exchange some of that momentum.
Blender can be used as a way to make the models required for the project.</p>
   <p><h3>Skills required</h3>
<p>The skills that would be required to make a project like this would be excellent knowledge of Unity, including experience with scripting, textures and animation. 
An example would be.</p>
<p>•	Familiarity with level design and planning.</p>
<p>•	Experience with game physics and particle systems.</p>
<p>•	Experience with mobile and console game development.</p>
<p>•	Experience with optimizing memory and space usage for support of hardware.</p>
<p>•	Experience with 3D.</p>

<a href="https://www.toptal.com/unity-unity3d/job-description">Reference for the requiremnets</a>
    
<p>In order to learn these skills, I can use “Unity Script” which is “JavaScript” and learn the necessary skills there or I can go to <a href="https://study.sae.edu.au/games/?utm_campaign=SAE-AUS-BNE-SGA-PSE-LDGNR-GGLGENRCSRCH-CDNOTSET-21T3-">C#</a>, which is widely used for developing desktop applications and web services but can also be used in game development with Unity.</p>
    <p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
If this project is successful, then I hope that it can be used as a reference for future projects to come. If not, then it would be a good experience since it invloves 3D development, camera movement, player collision and chaos, but in the end of the day its idea of turning something boring into something fun and interesting and fun can be used for pretty much anything, it just needs the right amount of code and enough put into it.</p>
