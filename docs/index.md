<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>My name is Ben Wakefield. My Student number is. s3912783, and you can contact me through my Student email address (S3912783@student.rmit.edu.au).
I’ve always had an interest in programing, drawing, and technology so if possible, I would like to get onto a career path that relates to at least one of these subjects. I was born and raised in Australia. 
I graduated from Springwood State Highschool in 2020, and I'm usually the quiet type so I like to spend my free time with my group of friends or playing video games for fun.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have always been curious with how the things around me work. As for the reason for me choosing RMIT over other Tafe courses, it would have to be the fact that it’s online study, that way I can work around a busy schedule since I'm still casual. I have no experience in the IT department as of now, but I intend to change that in the near future. Therefore my plan is to understand how many steps are needed in order to make a well performing website/games. Than gain skills to be able to manufacture those ideas into reality.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>As of now, I still have no idea what I want to do for my career. But some branches that peak my interest are;</p>
<p>•	Computer Systems Configure and Test
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52531566?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=9f8832fd-c94f-4e02-9891-bf28722b0595">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Electron’s production engineer 
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52500325?type=standard#searchRequestToken=82b12d87-2498-4ed0-97e1-b30600aee2d7">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Platform Developer
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52356347?type=standout#searchRequestToken=1fc6d478-638b-448e-84dd-fc8979b774c5">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	3D Animation 
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52500335?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=f376626f-69e5-471b-b537-edf57daba2e2">Seek.com.au</a></p>
<p>•	Game developer</p>
      
<p>I am interested in these positions because they seem like an interesting and fun environment to be in. I like the idea of experimenting with code, animation, assembling and testing electronics and it being presented in a way that can be of use to others even in non-ordinary situations.
As for the requirements needed for each of these, the one trait they all have in common is that they require good problem-solving capabilities, high work proficiency, good teamwork, a degree in said department and at least 2-3 years of hands-on experience at an industry environment. Additionally, for an 3D Animater/Game developer it is required that you have to know how game engines work, being able to make 3D or 2D models based on a source material, good mentality and the ability to work well under deadlines.
As of now, I only have some of these qualifications such as high proficiency in work situations and the ability to work under pressure. The rest of the qualifications I will have to work on but those will have to come with time. 
To overcome these issues, I hope that the group projects throughout this unit will help me develop more skills in communication as well as teamwork. Furthermore, I intend to do independent research on how I can be improving my methods and understanding game engines if my career goes in that direction.</p>

<p>The results of my Personality test shows that I'm an introvert at heart, I like to keep to myself when doing projects as I set patterns throughout my work, as for when these patterns don't match up, i often ask myself why it isn't working, hence the 57% in the judging factor. As for the The Logistcian type of learning, you can find more details about it on . As for my Learning Style, the results show that I tend to be able to learn better when i'm doing a physical activity, so upon seeing something new I will write it down, set it up in an example website see if theirs pattern to it and then write down exactly how it works. I usually do this by myself in the quiet, but when I'm stuck I see what other people have done for the same issuse, if that doesn't work I will reach out to others. I do not really know what its like to be part of an actual team yet since all the teams/groups I have been within the past at least one person has been dead weight and I have ended up worrying about every little mistake so I'm looking forward to it. </p>

<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<p>I honesty don't know what to put here</p>
<p>1 tech topic + 1 non tech topic</p>
<p>an example would be snowboarding, hiking, etc</p>
<p>and linking wireless tech. </p>
<p>Think about how these things can be improved upon </p>
